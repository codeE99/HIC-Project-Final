# HIC-Project-Final
My team's submission for our Human Interface Computing class's final project. I did a majority of the HTML and CSS, while my teammates did the Javascript, linked to their games, and made small changes to the HTML/CSS portion. The UFO game is one of their creations. The HTML/CSS was used from a template provided by a different class.
